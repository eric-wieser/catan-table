This comes in two parts:
* a volume to be removed from the center of a table ([stl](https://github.com/eric-wieser/catan-table/blob/master/table.stl))
* a piece to be made out of 0.25in plexiglass. ([stl](https://github.com/eric-wieser/catan-table/blob/master/plexiglass.stl))

## Manufacturing instructions

`table-combined.dxf` contains all the outlines to be cut into the table, which were cut as follows:

1. Outer hexagon: Cut with a 1" bit to a depth of 1/4"
2. Pentagons (boats): Cut with a 0.25" bit to a depth of 5/16"
3. Inner bounding polygon and contained rectangles: Cut with a 0.25" bit to a depth of 3/8"
4. Pentagons and bounding polygon: Finished with a 1/16" bit, to the same depths as before
